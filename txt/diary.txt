his wife, sister in law,
sisters, and [Illegible]
& his son & daughter, [Illegible]
[Illegible] Prints and a
whole lot of [Illegible], all
having free tickets from
[Illegible] who has but 
a stop & issued severe [Illegible]
for those that go to [Illegible]
without asking his permission
and even the permission
of the captain will not

of [Illegible] was carried through
the [Illegible] last time
down she had about 50 & 60
persons & [Illegible] had asked
Capt [Illegible] permission

told Johny my nephew
to tell us that he would
not allow them to go
without his permission;
this is a new thing that I

agent had [Illegible] so, I have

for a try [Illegible] like
that since I have been
in the service this is making
me disgusted and even these
people are laughing at
it, for it is no trouble to
them to ask him for a free
ticket which he is giving
