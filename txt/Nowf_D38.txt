theirs~ We learnt from the people
of the Phrat, that there is no Cholera
broken out at Amara,  the cause
of the order came to us not to 
stop at Amara on our way down
is that the Commodore Emin
Bey complained at Basreh that 
why should our steamers stop
there  the Turkish steamers do
not do it; this is a very absurd
thing, since our orders were so
from the beginning that we are
to stop on the way down;
Modte N.W.  fine, the Khalifah's
cargo came down in the Barge
as well as her passengers

other servant in Basreh, are
so bad to report that to Baghdad
but although the Doctor says
there are still some cases they 
are isolated as sporadic as
the disease is disappearing,
there are still some cases at 
Hammar on the Euphrates; 
The Doctor has got no new with
regard to the quarantine if
any change or reduction to 
five days which now ought 
to be lessened to five days 
instead of 10; He knows nothing 
about the Order which the
Waly of Basreh sent through 
the Consul to Lynch ordering
the Mejidieh not to communicate
at Amara on her way down,
Since the quarantine did not
issue such order, he had no
right to do so himself~ We
then left  went up to Rufails
place where I saw Tukyeh also 
Yousef Marine, Johny Loca and
his wife are all living there
they have made Huts for

Boat returned with letters from
Artin  one for me, he says that
the Phrat  Baghdad also came
alongside at Amara because
their Agent Hakim Effendi

What an absurd answer it appears
that Mr. Bottomly does not care
or think of our going to Baghdad
in making 10 days quarantine
and relieve our people from this
hard work of transhipping cargo,
our both Barges are astern of
us off the bank~
	Subsection: 15 Satur
Modte N.W.  fine cool morning,
ship went alongside the bank [illegible]
Capt. Cowley  I went on shore and 
saw Dr. Malakis; he said that
we can discharge our cargo in the
Barge as he received a counter order
since we left last time to do the
same as before;
Our Deckmen when they were
told to discharge cargo this morning
they all refused  stuck work
they say that they cannot do 
the work without assistance

Page 070:

they were told by [BREAK IN PAGE]
That as no coolies could he got
to assist, they must do the best
they can  even if it takes them
several days, still they refused
so he telegraphed to Lynch to
send 14 new crew by Khalifah
 these will be discharged,
So we are doing nothing today,
At 4.30 P.M. the steam Launch
Venture came down from Baghdad,
 went alongside up above the 
Ressafah; I received a letter from
Henry  enclosed a smal chit from
Eliza written by Alexander they
say that they did not know that
the steam Launch was leaving, 
they are all well  will write 
by the Khalifah leaving on
Sunday; I closed my letter
for Eliza only  sent the other 
letters from Basreh  Amara
also  put them all in Lynch's
Bag  we sent the letter Bags etc
to the steam Launch at 5 1\2
she is taking the Coal 1 1/2 Ton

there is no news when the quarantine

In turning the cargo from our

she has just heard from Johny
 that Mr. Bottomly told him 
that the Mejidieh will make

guess that yesterday's telegram
to Cawley was to get 14 Tons
Coal ready is not for the 
Khalifah but for the Steam
Launch as Chow Chow her

be 1 ? Ton,  the mistake is
