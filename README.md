# Svoboda-Diaries-Applications
Program for text analysis and word identification for transcribers within the Svoboda Diaries Project at the University of Washington.

The user can add a diary txt file to the txt folder to be used as a dictionary of words existing in the author's vocabulary. The user can then use the program to identify illegible words while transcribing if they can identify specific letters and their order within the word.

Currently, the program is only usable through a terminal based ui by executing the Client.java file. Working to implement a React website based ui.
